            <p>
            I got my Associate Degree in Information Technology last June. 
              I got accepted at George Washington University to finish my Bachelorâ€™s Degree, but I decided to join the GW Bootcamp instead. I am currently a GW Bootcamp student. 
              However, attending this course will help me learn the fundamentals of becoming a full-stack developer.  So I can apply my knowledge to solve real problems in my future job. 
                I bring passion and enthusiasm to everything I do and have an insatiable thirst for knowledge in this area. 
                I persist to achieve and seek my goals.
